# Advanced Cross Filter (Custom Visualization)

This is a Custom Visualization for Looker that functions as an interactive filter. **Unlike standard dashboard filters, it allows for free placement anywhere on the dashboard and triggers instant updates without requiring an update button.**

(There is a Gemini mark on the image, but I just used Gemini to white out the image. Apart from this editing, it is the actual screen.)

*Note: Parts of this code were generated using Gemini. As a custom visualization, this is not officially supported by Looker/Google. Please use at your own risk.*

## Key Features (Pros)

### 🚀 Instant Interaction
**No need to press an "Update" button.**
Filtering is applied immediately upon selection, providing a seamless user experience.

### 🎨 Flexible Layout
**Place it anywhere.**
Since this acts as a visualization tile, you can position it anywhere on your dashboard layout. cf.Standard filters are restricted to the top or right side of the dashboard.

### 📊 Integrated Data Visualization
**Visualize Measures.**
You can display measures alongside your filter dimensions using data bars and color scales, giving context to the filter options.

### 🖌️ Granular Design Control
Customize backgrounds, transparency levels, and even use images as backgrounds for a highly polished look.

> **Side Note:** I actually struggled a bit to generate this surreal truck image (where the background time axes are distorted) using Gemini, but it eventually turned out with surprisingly high precision!

## Limitations & Considerations (Cons)

* **Query Cost / Performance:**
    * **Increased Query Volume:** Because of the cross-filtering nature, clicking a tile immediately triggers a query. This ease of use can lead to higher query counts compared to standard filters where users batch selections before updating.
    * **Sequential Processing:** When selecting multiple items, filters are applied one by one (sequential queries) rather than processing a batch of selections at once.
* **Functional Differences:**
    * Some complex logic available in standard filters (e.g., relative date logic like "Today") is not currently supported.
    * *Included Features:* Partial match, Exclude, Number range, and Regex search are implemented.

## Data Requirements

* **Dimension:** 1 Field (Required)
* **Measure:** Optional (For data bars and color scale)

## Disclaimer
This is a custom visualization sample. If you require additional features, you may try modifying the code using AI tools like Gemini. Support is not provided for this visualization.

**Note on Translation:**
The README and code were originally created in Japanese and translated/refined using Gemini. Please be aware that there may be unnatural phrasing or translation errors.---
